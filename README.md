# Electricty hourly demand

## Overview
This project represents the culmination of my college journey, serving as the final project before graduating from Loyola College . Over the past three years, I've had the opportunity to work on approximately 20 different projects, each contributing to my growth as a student and aspiring professional. This capstone project encapsulates the skills, knowledge, and experiences gained throughout my academic career.

## Motivation
Projects have been an integral part of my college experience, allowing me to bridge the gap between theory and practice. They have provided me with opportunities to tackle real-world problems, collaborate with peers, and develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. This final project serves as a testament to my journey and the invaluable lessons learned along the way.

## Project Description
The project focuses on predicting energy demand using machine learning techniques. Leveraging historical data on various energy generation sources, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can forecast energy demand accurately. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two CSV files:
- `electricity_data.csv`: Contains information about electricity generation from different sources and actual load.
- `weather_data.csv`: Contains weather-related data such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover.

## Notebook
The notebook `energy_demand_prediction.ipynb` provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. It also includes detailed explanations of the code and insights derived from the analysis.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional features to enhance model performance.
- Explore alternative machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Deploy the project to a cloud platform for wider accessibility.
- Continuously update and refine the model with new data.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to Loyola College, my professors, peers, and mentors for their support and guidance throughout this journey.
